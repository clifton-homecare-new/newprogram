            h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>To apply best and standardised practices in the management of falls and unwell service users.</p>

            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Slip:</strong> to slide involuntarily and lose one’s balance or foothold</li>
                <li><strong>Trip:</strong> an accidental misstep threatening (or causing) a fall</li>
                <li><strong>Stumble:</strong> to step awkwardly while walking and begin to fall</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> ‘an event’ which results in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or floor or other lower level (with or without loss of consciousness)</li>
                <li><strong>Unexplained fall:</strong> when a fall has not been witnessed, a cause cannot be identified or the person does not know how or why they fell.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>All slips, trips, stumbles, falls and unexplained falls.</p>

            <h2>Policy</h2>
            <p>All staff will be trained in the assessment and prevention of falls. A dynamic review of plan of care and falls prevention will be made regularly by management and/or senior staff at Clifton Homecare (CHCL).</p>
            <p>All falls by service users, however apparently trivial, will be immediately recorded in the Care Plan daily records for that service user and in the Falls register at CHCL office and in the service user’s care plan (located at their address). Each fall will be assessed and considered significant. A falls referral will be requested directly through the Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Falls team with appropriate consent. The referral form is stored on the L drive of the computer. Completed referral forms are stored in the service user’s office file and on the L drive in the ‘completed Falls referrals’ folder. Note when assessing a service user when they have fallen must include completion of the Falls and Unwell checklist, including base line observation by a trained member of staff. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS 2) must be calculated and the relevant follow-up clinical advice sought if the NEWS 2 score is above 0 (see checklist).</p>
            <p>All service users will be assessed with regards their risk of falling as per the falls risk assessment tool (FRAT tool). Service users who score more than 3 of the below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take more than 4 medications per day;</li>
                <li>Who have had a stroke or have a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease;</li>
                <li>Are unbalanced when walking;</li>
                <li>Are unable to rise from a chair at knee height without using the chair arms;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Are classed as being at a high risk of falls. Service users who score less than 3 are classed as low risk of falls and a referral to the Enhanced Primary care team may be preferential. The Managing Director will help assess the most appropriate referral for the service user. The decision will be made in collaboration with the service user and/or family members.</p>

            <h2>The ‘STEADY- ON’ tool is used to assess;</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Slippers/footwear worn by the service user; foot and toe nail health;</li>
                <li>Tablets/medications which may cause drowsiness or unsteadiness or may cause the service user an increase in toilet visits, i.e. diuretics;</li>
                <li>Environment will be assessed for trip hazards and lighting, uneven floor surfaces, change in floor surfaces;</li>
                <li>Activity and general exercise of the service user will be assessed, taking are to assess deconditioning from a lack of activity;</li>
                <li>Falls which have occurred previously will be considered</li>
                <li>Eyesight, i.e. any issues with vision and last eye test will be considered; also if the service user has multiple pairs of glasses meaning they may not wear the right prescription for the correct activity, if indeed they wear their glasses at all.</li>
                <li>Other necessary considerations; staff training; compliance of service user and family, equipment; new or old/ complex or not, service dates, Rockwood Clinical frailty score;</li>
                <li>Nutrition and hydration; does the service user eat regular meals and keep themselves hydrated or are they likely to experience frequent Urinary tract infections and have low blood pressure due to dehydration and poor food intake.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The ‘STEADY’ tool is an excellent tool designed to prompt assessments which may otherwise be overlooked.</p>

            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <h3>In the event of a service user falling, witnessed by a staff member:</h3>
            <p>If a service user is seen to be in an imminent state of collapse; lower the person gently to the floor rather than trying to lift the person back on to their feet. An unconscious reflex may be to catch the service user mid fall/ collapse and lift them back up. This may result in injury to the service user and/or staff member. CHCL will not support employees who choose to use unsafe practices which are not in line with moving and handling training and practices shown. The service user must be carefully lowered to the floor and the primary survey commenced.</p>

            <h3>In the event of a service user having fallen:</h3>
            <p>A PRIMARY SURVEY of airway, catastrophic haemorrhage, breathing and circulation will be performed to check that the service user’s airway is not compromised, they are breathing adequately and they have a pulse. If the service user has sustained a head injury and they are on any anti-coagulants (Warfarin, Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Edoxaban (Lixiana), Heparin for example) medical advice should be sought from North West Ambulance Service (999). The service user will require a scan to ensure a significant haemorrhage as not be caused as a result of the head injury and the anti-coagulant medication. Providing the service user is not currently fitting and is not thought to have collapsed as a result of low blood sugar (see medical history; Diabetes will be included in Medical history section C of the care plan) and the primary survey does not reveal any immediate concern then a secondary survey will be conducted.</p>
            <p>If the service user does not know how they fell or cannot recall falling then the history prior to the fall is inadequate. This must be treated with the utmost care and caution as the service user may have come to rest on the floor or lower surface as a result of a collapse. Medical advice must be sought in such circumstances by ringing North West Ambulance Service (999). If it is deemed necessary to send an ambulance to assess the service user, completion of the secondary survey must be discussed with North West Ambulance Service’s call handler; to prevent the service user remaining on a hard surface for a long period of time. If service users are left for prolonged periods of time on hard floors deterioration in the service user’s condition is highly likely. The service user could result in hypothermia, pressure ulcers may develop and a condition called Rhabdomyolysis may be caused. History taking when managing falls is essential to ensure the service user did not experience chest pain, shortness of breath and/ or heart palpitations immediately prior to the fall. Symptoms such as this prior to a fall indicate the fall may actually have been a collapse caused by a medical condition.</p>

            <p>Despite whether the service user is advised to be kept on the floor awaiting further assessment by clinically trained professionals or whether it is deemed more appropriate to assist them up off the floor awaiting further clinical assessment or they are deemed uninjured and safe to be left at home base line observations must be completed. The base line observations to be taken are;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respiratory rate (usual range 12-20 breaths per minute)</li>
                <li>Oxygen saturations (usual range greater than 96%, unless the service user has chronic respiratory conditions and the medical history states that they retain carbon dioxide. See NEWS 2 chart for this acceptable range.)</li>
                <li>Blood pressure (usual range for the systolic blood pressure mmHG is 111-219)</li>
                <li>Pulse (usual range 51-90 beats per minute)</li>
                <li>Conscious level (alert being usual response, new onset or confusion or new worsening of confusion, alert only to voice, pain or unconscious all requiring further clinical assessment)</li>
                <li>Temperature (usual range 36.1-38.0 degrees Celsius).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The NEWS 2 score is then to be calculated using the above observations and the appropriate response actioned.</p>
            <p>Base line observations and calculation of NEWS 2 score will help North West Ambulance Service, 111 or the service user’s GP practice to triage the service user more accurately.</p>

            <h2>Dehydration</h2>
            <p>Signs of dehydration may include; dry tongue, sunken eyes, decreased skin elasticity (pinch test taking more than 2 seconds or the skin to lie back down) and low urine output.</p>
            <p>Record all details and observations on the checklist. If unable to document the extent of a service user’s injuries until service user is back from the hospital/walk in centre then document this fact. Document the fall on the falls register and inform the office for the details to be added to the office Falls register. Use the communication form and whatsapp group to alert other staff members and complete the falls register and associated documentation when the service user returns from hospital.</p>
            <p>Immediately relay to the On-call Manager.</p>
            <p>The Manager will ensure that:-</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All staff are trained to record/report all falls and to prevent and assess falls and service users who have fallen.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All reports of a fall result in an immediate dynamic review of the falls plan of care for the affected service user, according to the formats in the Care Plan pack. Any trends in falls will be looked for and if identified investigated promptly.</p>
            <p>The Care Plan review is a holistic process. Please ensure that the service user/relatives/friends/informal carers are encouraged to participate in the review process.</p>

            <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <p>It is essential that employees of CHCL abide by and respect The Care Act (2014) at all times. Service users are entitled to make decisions considered by others as unwise and this must be respected. A risk assessment can help to reduce the risk or make provisions to reduce the likelihood of the hazard occurring.</p>
            <p>It is not appropriate to inhibit exercise as research has proven that physical activity not only reduces the susceptibility of falls but improves cardiovascular fitness, strength and physical function, reduces cognitive decline and can improve mental wellbeing; self-esteem and low mood. With the correct support service user’s overall wellbeing may improve due to regular walks, trips out etc.</p>
            <p>Alcohol advice can be sought from the service user’s GP if alcohol is deemed to be a contributory factor for falls occurring.</p>
            <p>A Safeguarding concern may need to be raised if CHCL have failed to complete falls risk assessments which may have prevented the fall, if the care plan has not been updated accordingly or if the service user is experiencing repetitive falls. Refer to the Lancashire County Council Safeguarding Concern checklist for clarity. If ever unsure whether to refer or not liaise with the Managing Director. Advice is usually to report to Lancashire County Council if a Safeguarding concern has been queried.</p>
            <p>In addition to a Falls Team referral a referral to the Occupational therapy team, Community Frailty team or Enhanced Primary Care Team may be beneficial. There is guidance on what the teams can offer, stored on the L Drive of the computer, however the Managing Director will assist with this decision process.</p>
